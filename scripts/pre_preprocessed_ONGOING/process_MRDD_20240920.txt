####################### WELCOME TO HYGIEIA script #######################
#########################################################################
This script will process your dataframe and: 
        - eliminate incorrect molecules ans sanitize smiles
        - clean salts
        - eliminate inorganic and organometallic compounds
        - check for duplicated molecules
        - check for mixtures.
A file located in ".\results" folder is needed
This file must be called: "\TOX_MRDD_DeepPK-preprocessed.csv"
Extra columns are available in the input file:

['ID', 'orig_ID', 'SMILES', 'y', 'CAS', 'NAME', 'UNITS', 'smiles_source']
What to you want to do with them?.

        [1] Ignore extra data and remove it from following steps.

                  "SMILES" will be the only filtered/sanitized column and "y" will be the only redirected output.

        [2] Keep them in the output.

                  SMILES will be only the filtered/sanitized column but all the rest will be redirected in the output.

        [3] Keep them in the output and use them to check duplicates.

                  More than one column will be used for filtering: SMILES will be for sanitize, mixture, salts and inorganics,
                  the rest of the columns (except y) for checking for duplicates.

        [4] Select which columns I want to keep and  which to use them to check duplicates.

                  Provide a list with two lists [check dups, keep] do not include your SMILES and y
SMILES y ['ID', 'orig_ID', 'SMILES', 'y', 'CAS', 'NAME', 'UNITS', 'smiles_source']
[+] Sanitizing smiles (Always done)

        Congratulations, your dataset has not salts.
[+] Eliminating inorganic and organometallic compounds
        Congratulations, your dataset has not inorganic and organometallic compounds.
[+] Checking for repeated compounds considering extra data
        Congratulations, your dataset has not duplicated compounds.
[+] Checking for mixtures
[]
        Congratulations, your dataset has not mixtures.

A new file has been generated:

.\results\TOX_MRDD_DeepPK.csv: contains the unique molecules, following your instructions
['ID', 'orig_ID', 'CAS', 'NAME', 'UNITS', 'smiles_source'] [] Index(['ID', 'SAN_SMILES', 'MOL_OBJECT', 'ORIGINAL_SMILES', 'orig_ID',
       'SMILES', 'y', 'CAS', 'NAME', 'UNITS', 'smiles_source'],
      dtype='object')
Your input dataset has 1200 molecules.
Your output dataset has 1200 molecules.
